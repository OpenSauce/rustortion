# Rustortion

A basic low-latency guitar amp simulator, built in Rust using JACK (via PipeWire).

This is heavily under development, probably broken, so use at your own risk.

## Requirements

- Linux with PipeWire (with JACK support enabled)
- `libjack` and JACK tools installed
- Rust: [https://rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install)
